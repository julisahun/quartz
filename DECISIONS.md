# Decisions

Answers to the open questions in `~/.claude/plans/selfhosted-notes-initial-plan.md`
(section 8), settled on 2026-09-05. Recorded here so they are not silently
re-opened later.

| # | Question | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Search in scope? | **Yes**, FTS5 from the start | The SQLite index is there anyway, so it costs one virtual table. Server-side from M1; the UI lands in M2. |
| 2 | Attachments and pasted images? | **Yes, v1** | Binary files ride the same `/api/file` endpoints. Paste handling in the editor is the real work, not the server. |
| 3 | Encryption at rest? | **No** | Plaintext `.md` on the Pi's SD card is what lets Obsidian keep working on the same vault — the plan's whole safety net. Protection is the Cloudflare tunnel, the home LAN, and a single account. Revisit if the vault ever leaves the house. |
| 4 | Single user forever? | **Yes** | One account, no path scoping, no sharing. Multi-user would change auth and path handling shape. |
| 5 | Name and repo | **`quartz`** | `julisahun/quartz`, following `aegis` / `pirdle` / `pergamino`. |
| 6 | Vault on `home-lab` if repaired? | **No — the Pi** | `home-lab` is out of scope entirely. This workload never outgrows the Pi. |

## Decisions taken while building

- **Pure-Go SQLite** (`modernc.org/sqlite`) rather than `mattn/go-sqlite3`, so
  the binary stays CGO-free and cross-compiles to the Pi from a hosted runner.
  FTS5 is compiled in, which is what makes decision 1 free.
- **The server serves the PWA itself** (`QUARTZ_WEB_DIR`) instead of a second
  nginx vhost: one origin for the app and the API means the session cookie and
  the service worker just work, and one cloudflared ingress rule covers both.
- **Preconditions are mandatory on every write.** `If-Match: <hash>` to replace,
  `If-None-Match: *` to create; a request with neither is refused with 428.
  There is no way to blind-write over another device's edit.
- **`.quartz*` is a reserved prefix** in the vault: temp files during atomic
  writes and the CLI's sync state live there and are never synced.
- **The watcher is registered before the startup reconciliation**, not after,
  so a write landing during startup cannot fall between the two.
